- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with regular art and science events to stoke climate change resilient coastal community
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about different types of seaweed
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: obanseaweedgardens@gmail.com
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: they/them (Seaweed Gardens) or she/her (Danielle)
- âš¡ Fun fact: Seaweeds contain potassium, iron, sulphur and calcium. All things plants need to grow.
